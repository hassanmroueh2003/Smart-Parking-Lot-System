# Smart-Parking-Lot-System
This project implements a **smart parking lot** system using a **PIC18F45K22 microcontroller**, programmed in **C** with **MPLAB**, and validated using **Proteus simulation**. The system monitors three parking spots and automates gate control, displays availability, and ensures real-time interaction with cars using sensors.
